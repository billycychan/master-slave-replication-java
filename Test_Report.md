## 9. Issues and Observations
- **Known Limitations**:
  - System requires manual intervention for master node failure
  - Recovery time increases with the number of failed nodes
  - Performance may degrade under high failure rates
- **Observations**:
  - System maintains data consistency even under high failure rates
  - Recovery mechanism effectively synchronizes failed nodes
  - Read operations remain available even with some node failures
  - System handles out-of-order log entries gracefully
