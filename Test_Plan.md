# Test Plan: Master-Slave Replication System

## 1. Introduction / Overview

### Purpose of the Test Plan
This test plan outlines the strategy, approach, and execution details for testing the Master-Slave Replication System. The primary goal is to ensure the system's reliability, fault tolerance, and data consistency under various conditions.

### Project Background
The Master-Slave Replication System is a distributed system that implements a leader-follower architecture for data replication. It ensures data consistency across multiple nodes while providing fault tolerance and high availability.


## 2. Test Objectives

### Functional Objectives
- Verify correct implementation of write/read operations
- Validate data consistency across master and slave nodes
- Test replication mechanisms and log entry propagation
- Verify system behavior during node failures
- Validate recovery procedures
- Test system initialization and shutdown procedures

### Non-Functional Objectives
- Measure system performance under load
- Evaluate fault tolerance capabilities
- Assess recovery time after failures
- Verify system stability during continuous operations
- Test system behavior under high failure rates

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope
- Basic CRUD operations
- Replication mechanisms
- Failure handling and recovery
- Data consistency verification
- System initialization and shutdown
- Performance under normal conditions
- Fault tolerance up to 70% node failure rate

### Out-of-Scope
- Network partition scenarios (beyond basic failure simulation)
- Security testing
- Load testing beyond 1000 concurrent operations
- Long-term stability testing (>24 hours)
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Database persistence mechanisms
